# Javascript Password Generator

## Completely custom randomized password made easy

Have you ever run into an issue where you need a secure randomized password but don't want to make one yourself?

**We've got you covered**, [and you can try it for yourself here](https://rgarrettlee.github.io/password-generator/)

This site generates a password based on specific criteria determined by the user to ensure that the password is secure and meets the user's requirements.

The criteria we allow users to choose are:
- Length of password
- Uppercase charcter inclusion
- Lowercase character inclusion
- Numeric character inclusion
- Special character inclusion

> ### These passwords are completely randomized and safe to use
